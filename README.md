# iOmicsPASS
iOmicsPASS is a powerful bioinformatics tool for network-based data integration and predictive feature selection. The tool integrates multiple -omics datasets over biological networks and identifies important subnetworks as signatures for distinguishing different sample groups (i.e. phenotypes). It is a supervised method where the classification of the samples is known in the training data. The tool can be applied in clinical settings, to better understand the biological mechanisms underlying the differences across groups of samples (e.g. when comparing disease versus non-disease group) in studies with multiple related -omics data.
